## Prerequisites

### Software Requirements
- **Python**: 3.x (tested up to Python 3.7)
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations
- **Matplotlib**: For plotting and visualization
- **SciPy**: For scientific computing functions

### Installation
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
```

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Vector Fitting (Project 1)
Start with the vector fitting examples to understand the core algorithm:
```bash
cd Project1
python ex3.py  # Single port system
```

### 2. Circuit Synthesis (Project 2)
Convert pole-residue data to circuit components:
```bash
cd Project2
python Project2.py
```

### 3. Passivity Enforcement (Project 3)
Ensure circuit stability:
```bash
cd Project3
python Project3.py
```

### 4. Complete Workflow (Final Project)
Run the complete pipeline:
```bash
cd "Final Project"
python Final_Project.py
```

## File Organization

### Images Directory
Each project includes an `images/` subdirectory where all generated plots and visualizations are automatically saved. This keeps the project directories clean and organized.

### Data Files
- **CSV files**: Contain pole-residue data and state-space matrices
- **MAT files**: MATLAB format data (e.g., `ex2_Y.mat`)
- **NPZ files**: NumPy compressed data files
- **SP files**: SPICE netlists for circuit simulation

## Output Files

### Generated Netlists
- `spice_net_list.sp` - Main SPICE netlist (Projects 2 and Final)
- `P3.sp` - Project 3 passivity-enforced netlist

### Visualization Files
All plots are saved to the respective `images/` directories:
- Frequency response plots
- Eigenvalue analysis
- Fitting accuracy comparisons
- Passivity verification plots

## Testing

### Unit Tests
The Final Project includes a comprehensive test suite:
```bash
cd "Final Project/test"
python test_rpdriver.py
python test_vfdriver.py
```

### Validation
- Compare fitted data with original frequency response
- Verify passivity through eigenvalue analysis
- Test SPICE netlists in circuit simulators (ADS, PSPICE)

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Python Version Compatibility
- Ensure Python 3.x is used (tested up to 3.7)
- Some scripts may require specific NumPy/SciPy versions

### File Path Issues
- Use relative paths within each project directory
- Ensure all required data files are present before running scripts

### Memory Issues
- Large frequency datasets may require significant memory
- Consider reducing model order for very large datasets

## Contributing

### Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 Python style guidelines
- Include docstrings for all functions
- Add comments for complex algorithms

### Testing
- Add unit tests for new functionality
- Validate results against known test cases
- Ensure backward compatibility
